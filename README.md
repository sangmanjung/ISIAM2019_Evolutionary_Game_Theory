- Abstract
  >In this work, we investigate the effects of two games on spatial dynamics: Prisonersâ€™Dilemma and Hawk-Dove games. We employ three different approaches including a lattice network model, replicator equations, and partial differential equations. We study spatial dynamics under various conditions: different payoff, and initial configurations. The results are compared with the ones of replicator equations and partial differential equations.
